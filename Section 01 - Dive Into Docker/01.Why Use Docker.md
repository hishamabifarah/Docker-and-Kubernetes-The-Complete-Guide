> Why Use Docker?

 ##### Docker makes it really easy to install and run software without worrying about setup or dependencies. #####


 #####  Suppose we have to install a new software on our personal computer.
 ##### We follow the steps:

- download installer
- run installer
- Get an error message
- troubleshoot issue
- re run install
- get another error.

Docker would make it easier for us to install the new software,
not just on personal computers, but on web servers as well, or any cloud based computing platform.

## Example given installing redis and getting an error.
redis: an in memory data store.

to install redis we need to do the following:
- $ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-6.0.6.tar.gz
- $ tar xzf redis-6.0.6.tar.gz
- $ cd redis-6.0.6
- $ make

when we try to run the first command, we will get an error message:
command not found: wget. 
wget is not intalled on my local machine.

with Docker we run the command: docker run -it redis 
an instance of redis will up and running instantly.
